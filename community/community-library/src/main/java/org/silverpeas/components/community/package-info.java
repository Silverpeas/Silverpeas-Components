/**
 * Silverpeas Web Application Component to manage a community of users for a collaborative space. By
 * default, a collaborative space is visible either only to the users having access rights to it or
 * to all users in the case of a public space. The decision to give access rights to users in
 * Silverpeas are decided unilaterally only by space managers. With this application, a
 * collaborative space can become a community space, that is a space with a community of users. In
 * this case, the space is visible to anyone (but not its content in subspaces, applications,
 * contributions, ...) and any user in Silverpeas can ask to join the community of the space. When
 * joining such a community, the user gain then access rights to the space.
 * <p>
 * To allow this Community application to manage the community of users for a given space, the
 * recommended way is to instantiated this application into the targeted space and then to declare
 * it as the home page of that space.
