      Usually we block access to
      something because you do not have the correct privileges (<em>e.g.</em>,
      read, edit, comment) for the page you are looking for. In this particular case,
      it is likely that you are not listed in the page&rsquo;s access control list
      or that your privileges aren&rsquo;t high enough (you want
      to edit, but ACL only allows &lsquo;read&rsquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible that JSPWiki cannot find its security policy, or that
      the policy is not configured correctly. Either of these cases would cause
      JSPWiki to block access, too.
