#  This is the JSPWiki configuration file.  You'll need to edit this
#  a bit.  The first few lines are the most important ones.
#
#  Wherever it is said that an option can be "true" or "false", you can
#  also use "yes"/"no", or "on/off".  Just for some convenience.
#
#
#  You can use this to override the default application name.  It affects
#  the HTML titles and logging, for example.  It can be different from
#  the actual web name (http://my.com/mywiki) of the application, but usually
#  it is the same.
#
jspwiki.applicationName = silverpeas

#
#  Which page provider class to use.  Possibilities are:
#
#    RCSFileProvider        - for simple RCS-based file storage
#    FileSystemProvider     - for simple pure file storage with no version information
#    VersioningFileProvider - for simple, non-RCS based versioning storage.
#
#  Note that if you're upgrading from JSPWiki 1.x, then you need to remove the
#  "com.ecyrd.jspwiki." part from the beginning of the path.
#
jspwiki.pageProvider = SilverpeasVersioningFileProvider

#
#  Set to true, if you want to cache page data into memory.  This is
#  in general a good idea.
#
#  Default is false (no cache).
#
#  NB: This replaces the JSPWiki 1.x "CachingProvider" setting, since it
#      probably was too confusing.
#	
jspwiki.usePageCache = false

#
#  Determines where wiki files are kept for FileSystemProvider
#  and RCSFileProvider
#
#  If you're using Windows, then you must duplicate the backslashes.
#  For example, use:
#
#  jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir = C:\\Data\\jspwiki
#
jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir = C:\\tmp\\jspwiki\\pages

#
#  The JSPWiki working directory.  If not set, a temporary path will
#  be used.  You can see the location of the workdir in the logs.
#  It is HIGHLY recommended that you set this.
#
#  The working directory is used to cache things like Lucene search
#  results.
#
jspwiki.workDir =C:\\tmp\\jspwiki\\indexes

#
#  ATTACHMENTS:
#
#  Use the following property to define which attachment provider
#  you want to use.  You have basically two choices:
#    * Set the value to BasicAttachmentProvider
#      a simple, flat file versioning provider
#    * Leave the value empty (or just comment the line out)
#      the attachment functionality is disabled
#
jspwiki.attachmentProvider = WikiVersioningAttachmentProvider

#
#  The BasicAttachmentProvider needs to know where to store the files
#  the user has uploaded.  It's okay to put these in the same directory
#  as you put your text files (i.e. the pageDir setting above).
#
#  If you're using Windows, then you must duplicate the backslashes.
#  For example, use:
#
#  jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.storageDir = C:\\Data\\jspwiki
#
jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.storageDir =  C:\\tmp\\jspwiki

#
#  You can tell the BasicAttachmentProvider to add a flag
#  so that browsers do not cache certain (or all) attachment
#  types. This is useful in intranet environments. You should activate
#  this if your users complain that their excel files are not uploaded
#  correctly and they still do have an old version: Usually the
#  file was uploaded correctly, but they get the locally cached version
#  
#  You can use regular expressions to disable the cache, e.g the
#  following example will disable browser cache for all excel and word files
#
#  If you don't define this property, cache is enabled by default for
#  all attachments
#  
#  jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.disableCache = .*\.xls|.*\.doc

#
#  You can limit the maximum size of an attachment by setting this
#  value.  The value is in bytes, and by default all attachments
#  are accepted.
#
#  The following line would limit the attachment size to 100,000 bytes
#jspwiki.attachment.maxsize=100000

#
#  By default JSPWiki accepts all types of attachments.  However, you
#  can allow some types only, or forbid some other types.  By default,
#  all file types are allowed (if you do not specify the "allow" list
#  at all or it is empty).
#
#  These both are space-separated lists of file suffixes
#
#  Example: Allow only PNG, JPG, ZIP and JAR file attachments
#jspwiki.attachment.allow=.png .jpg .zip .jar

#  Example: Forbid HTML, PHP, ASP and EXE
#jspwiki.attachment.forbid=.html .htm .php .asp .exe

#
#  page Diff Representation
#
#  To show differences between page versions, you can define a
# difference provider.
#  The following choices are available:
#    * TraditionalDiffProvider - Uses internal (java) diff
#        to create a list of changes and shows it line by
#        line colored. This is the default
#    * ContextualDiffProvider - Uses internal (java) diff
#        to create changes inline and shows it on a word by
#        word basis using CSS. This is much superior to the
#        traditional diff provider, however, it is still quite
#        new and not much tested. YMMV.
#    * ExternalDiffProvider - uses a system diff program (which
#        can be configured using "jspwiki.diffCommand") to
#        create an unified (!) diff.
#
#        Example for a diff command:
#        jspwiki.diffCommand = /usr/bin/diff -u %s1 %s2
#
jspwiki.diffProvider = TraditionalDiffProvider

#
#  BaseURL can be used to rewrite all of JSPWiki's internal references.
#  Sometimes, especially if you're behind a address-rewriting firewall,
#  relative URLs don't work since the servlet container has no idea
#  where it's actually located.
#
#  Leave undefined if you want to rely on what your servlet container
#  thinks of where your application lives.
#
#  You MUST, however, define this one if you want to enable RSS (see below).  In
#  general, this is a good idea to define it anyway.  Do not forget the
#  trailing slash.
#
#  Example:
#  jspwiki.baseURL = http://www.jspwiki.org/
#
#jspwiki.baseURL=/

jspwiki.baseURL = /silverpeas/Rwiki/

#  Determines if you need to have relative urls or not.  If the baseURL
#  is not set, then this has no effect, but if you set the baseURL (which
#  is highly recommended), you can use this to set relative urls.
#
#  Possible values are "absolute" and "relative".
#
#jspwiki.referenceStyle=relative
jspwiki.referenceStyle=absolute


#
#  Determines which character encoding JSPWiki should use.  If you want
#  to support all languages in your Wiki, you probably want to enable
#  this.  From JSPWiki 2.2, it is strongly suggested that you use UTF-8.
#
#  Note that you can't switch these in the mean time, since the way the
#  files are encoded on disk is incompatible between ISO-Latin1 and UTF-8.
#  Don't try.  You'll get all sorts of interesting problems, if you do.
#
#  Possible values are 'ISO-8859-1' (default, if none has been specified)
#  and 'UTF-8'.
jspwiki.encoding = UTF-8

#
#  Determines whether raw HTML is allowed as Wiki input.
#
#  THIS IS A DANGEROUS OPTION!
#
#  If you decide to allow raw HTML, understand that ANY person who has
#  access to your Wiki site can embed ANY sort of malicious JavaScript,
#  or plugin, or ActiveX, or whatever on your site.  They can even mess it
#  up so royally it is impossible for you to replace the situation without
#  the need of direct access to the repository.  So think twice before
#  allowing raw HTML on your own site.
#
#  Most probably you want to use this on Intranets, or personal servers,
#  where only a handful of people can access the wiki.
#
#  Text between {{{ and }}} -options is not affected by this setting, so
#  it's always safe to quote HTML code with those.
#
#  The default for this option is "false".
#
jspwiki.translatorReader.allowHTML = false

#  Usability niceties.
#
#
#  If this property is set to "true", then page titles are rendered
#  using an extra space between every capital letter.  It may make
#  page titles readable on some occasions, but it does have the
#  drawback of making the titles look a bit funny at times.
#
jspwiki.breakTitleWithSpaces = false

#
#  If set to true, this property means that "WikiName" and "WikiNames"
#  are considered equal when linking between them.  Setting this to
#  true does not prevent you from having both kinds of pages - we just
#  fall back to the other one if the primary name does not exist.
#
#  For any other language, you'll probably want to turn this off.
#
jspwiki.translatorReader.matchEnglishPlurals = true

#
#  If you set this to true, the Wiki translator will then also consider
#  "traditional" WikiNames (that is, names of pages JustSmashedTogether
#  without square brackets) as hyperlinks.  This technique is also
#  known as "CamelCase", or "BumpyCase", or "InterCapping".  I personally
#  like CamelCase as a word, which is why this property is named as it is :-).
#
#  By default this is false, since traditional WikiLinks may confuse newbies.
#
#  This option can be overridden on a per-page basis using the SET directive.
#
jspwiki.translatorReader.camelCaseLinks = false

#
#  This sets the default template used by the Wiki engine.  The templates
#  live in templates/<template name>.  JSPWiki will attempt to find three
#  basic templates from that directory: "ViewTemplate," "EditTemplate"

#
#  If the path is not specified (and there is no jspwiki_module.xml with the

#
#  URL Constructor
#
#  JSPWiki by default generates page and attachment links that use JSP
#  pages and request parameters. It can also use alternative URL
#  constructors so that URL pages resemble traditional website paths, too.
#  You have three choices for generating URLs:
#
#     DefaultURLConstructor - uses JSPs for all references:
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Main
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/Edit.jsp?page=Main
#
#     ShortURLConstructor - uses path-like reference style:
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/wiki/Main
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/wiki/Main?do=Edit
#
#     ShortViewURLConstructor - uses path-like references for views; JSPs for everything else:
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/wiki/Main
#         http://mywiki.com/jspwiki/Edit.jsp?page=Main
#
#  Of course, you can also write your own implementation if you wish.
#
#  For either of the ShortURL constructors, you can also specify a
#  prefix path to go in front of page names. By default, the
#  prefix is 'wiki/'.
#
#  Be warned that the ShortURLConstructor does not work well with any other editor
#  except the built-in plaintext one.  Use ShortViewURLConstructor if you plan
#  to enable any other ones.
#
#jspwiki.urlConstructor = DefaultURLConstructor
jspwiki.urlConstructor = SilverpeasURLConstructor

#############################################################################
#
#  Security, authentication and authorization
#

#  JSPWiki supports a plugin-based interface for talking to different
#  kinds of authentication and authorization systems. By "authentication,"
#  we mean a system for logging in a user to establish their identity.
#  By "authorization," we mean a system for figuring out what actions
#  users can perform based on their authenticated identities.
#
#  For users looking to get started quickly, the default settings below
#  should work fine. In addition to the properties below, you may also
#  want to set the following JRE runtime properties when running JSPWiki
#  or the servlet container it runs in:
#
#     java.security.auth.login.config==/path-to/jspwiki.jass
#     java.security.policy=/path-to/jspwiki.policy
#
#  See the jspwiki.properties and jspwiki.jaas files for more details on
#  how to do this. These files contain addition configuration options
#  for the JSPWiki security policy and authentication, respectively, although
#  the defaults should work fine. If you don't set the JRE properties,
#  JSPWiki will use default versions from the WEB-INF directory.

#  AUTHENTICATION
#  For authentication, JSPWiki uses JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization
#  Service). The Authentication system is configured in the jspwiki.jaas
#  file; by default it will attempt to leverage your servlet container's
#  authentication services, if present. JSPWiki also can use its own
#  authentication system, which is separate from the container.
#
#  JSPWiki will try to detect whether you are using container authentication
#  To use container authentication, you must uncomment
#  the <security-constraint> elements in WEB-INF/web.xml.
#
#  AUTHORIZATION (EXTERNAL)
#  For authorization, JSPWiki has a two-tier system. When we want to
#  determine whether a user has permission to perform a certain action,
#  we first consult an external "authorizer" to determine if the user
#  is a member of the required role. By default, JSPWiki uses the
#  servlet container's authorization service for this (that is, it
#  calls HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole(String) ).
#  However, you can use another Authorizer if you wish; specify that
#  class here.

#jspwiki.security = false
#jspwiki.authorizer = com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.authorize.SilverpeasWikiAuthorizer

#  AUTHORIZATION (GROUPS)
#  As an additional source of authorization, users can belong to discretionary
#  "wiki groups" that the users manage themselves. Wiki groups are stored in a
#  GroupDatabase. The default group database uses an XML file for persistent
#  storage. Override with your own GroupDatabase implementation with this property:

jspwiki.groupdatabase = com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.authorize.XMLGroupDatabase

#  The default group database implementation stores member lists
#  in an XML file. The location of this file should be in a secure directory
#  in the filesystem; for example, in /etc or your servlet container's
#  configuration directory If you do not supply a value for this property,
#  a blank group database will be initialized in the WEB-INF/ directory of the
#  deployed webapp. Since these directories are often overwritten when webapps
#  are undeployed or redeployed, you should probably set this property to
#  something useful as soon as you can. But for test wikis, it's probably
#  ok to leave this un-set, as long as users know that their groups could
#  "disappear" if the wiki app is ever redeployed.

#jspwiki.xmlGroupDatabaseFile = /etc/tomcat/groupdatabase.xml

#  USER DATABASE
#  User's wiki profiles are stored in a UserDatabase. The default user database
#  uses an XML file for persistent storage.
#  Override with your own UserDatabase implementation with this property:

jspwiki.userdatabase = com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.user.XMLUserDatabase

#  The default user database implementation stores usernames and passwords
#  in an XML file. Passwords are SHA-1 hashed. The location of this file
#  should be in a secure directory in the filesystem; for example, in
#  /etc or your servlet container's configuration directory.
#  If you do not supply a value for this property, a blank user database
#  will be initialized in the WEB-INF/ directory of the deployed webapp.
#  Since these directories are often overwritten when webapps are
#  undeployed or redeployed, you should probably set this property to
#  something useful as soon as you can. But for test wikis, it's probably
#  ok to leave this un-set, as long as users know that their profiles could
#  "disappear" if the wiki app is ever redeployed.

#jspwiki.xmlUserDatabaseFile = /etc/tomcat/userdatabase.xml

# You can also use a JDBC database for storing user profiles.
# See the online AuthenticationAndAuthorization2.3 docs for details on
# how to configure it.

#jspwiki.userdatabase = com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.user.JDBCUserDatabase

#  If your JSPWiki user database shares login information with your
#  web container's authentication realm, you can configure JSPWiki to
#  add container users. At present, this only works with JDBCUserDatabase,
#  and only if you've configured your web container to use a database
#  with compatible columns and tables. If you don't know what this means,
#  then leave this property set to FALSE (the default).

#jspwiki.userdatabase.isSharedWithContainer = false

#  ACCESS CONTROL LISTS
#  Last but not least, JSPWiki needs a way of reading and persisting page
#  access control lists. The default implementation reads these from the page
#  markup. For example: "[{ALLOW edit Charlie}]". If using a custom
#  ACL manager, specify the AclManager implementation class here:

jspwiki.aclManager          = com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.acl.DefaultAclManager

#  JavaMail configuration. If you wish to allow your users to recover
#  their passwords via email, you should configure these properties.
#  JavaMail can use either a container-managed JNDI resource factory
#  (recommended, and the default), or a stand-alone factory whose properties
#  are configured with mail.* properties in this file (below).
#

#  A. Configure the address from which the email appears to come.
#     If you're going to use a mail session obtained via JNDI, this setting
#     will only be used if it hasn't already been configured in the obtained
#     session itself. If you comment it out, JSPWiki will use its internal
#     default value.
#     If you're going to use a stand-alone mail session, you will surely want
#     to configure it, otherwise the internal default value will be used.
#
mail.from = @mail.from@

#  B. JNDI Resource Factory Configuration. JSPWiki will try this first.
#     You will need to configure your container to provide a JavaMail
#     resource factory. See your container documentation, or check our
#     fairly complete documentation (with examples for Tomcat) in
#     the JavaDocs for com.ecyrd.jspwiki.util.MailUtil.
#
#  JNDI resource name. The commented-out value is the default.
#jspwiki.mail.jndiname = mail/Session

#  C. Stand-alone Resource Factory. JSPWiki will use these values if JNDI fails.
#
#  Your SMTP host (i.e. the one which sends email)
mail.smtp.host = @mail.smtp.host@

# If for some reason the standard smtp port (25) is blocked, you can change it here
#mail.smtp.port = @mail.smtp.port@

# If you are using a webserver that is publically accessible it usually
# doesn't allow you to send mail anonymously
# (because then this mailserver would become an open relay).
# Therefore you can indicate your account information here...
#
#mail.smtp.account = @mail.smtp.account@
#mail.smtp.password = @mail.smtp.password@

# The properties below control connection timeouts and TLS (encryption)
# if the mailserver supports it. The commented-out values are the defaults.
#mail.smtp.timeout = 5000
#mail.smtp.connectiontimeout = 5000
#mail.smtp.starttls.enable = true

#
# Workflow configuration
#
# The following properties map specific workflow steps to their associated approvers
# The name of the workflow or decision is the part of the key after "jspwiki.approver.".
# This is a logical name JSPWiki uses to determine which Principal to consult for approval.
# The Principal is identified up by AuthorizationManager at runtime; it looks for a Principal
# match as follows: GroupPrincipals; Roles; WikiPrincipals/other principals. Thus, if a value
# of "Admin" is supplied JSPWiki will first check the GroupManager to see if group Admin exits;
# then the container roles, if any; then, user Principals. If the value is blank or the
# property is commented out, it means that the workflow does not require approval.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# Uncomment the next line to require the Admin group (or Admin user, if a group is not found)
# to approve wiki pages after saving.
#jspwiki.approver.workflow.saveWikiPage=Admin

# Uncomment the next line to require the Admin group to approve new user profiles
#jspwiki.approver.workflow.createUserProfile=Admin
