<%@ page isELIgnored ="false" %> 
<%-- This is a local JSP header file, which you can override in your own template
     if you want to put something in the head-section of the page.  This page is
     included after the commonheader.jsp.

     The JSPWiki default template and distribution will never have anything here
     except this comment.  Therefore it's safe to override without accidentally
     removing any functionality.

     Some things which you might want to put here would e.g. be your site tracker
     Javascript (like Google Analytics, or Sitemeter, or whatever).

     The safest trick would be to create your own template (say "sitetemplate") directory,
     and just put a new localheader.jsp in it.  JSPWiki will always use the
     files in the "default" template, if it cannot locate an equivalent file in
     your defined template directory.
